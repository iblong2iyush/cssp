{"name":"CSSP","tagline":"Crowd Source Social Shopping Platform","body":"### Opportunity\r\nIn the past 3 years, Online Shopping has flourished in a Country where the GDP\r\nrecently fell from 4.8 to 3.69 and yet falling day after day. While websites\r\nlike Myntra and Jabong remain the major players of the Market and advertise\r\nthemselves to the Indian Sentimental Economy encouraging people to spend more\r\nand more on luxury items derailing the conventional markets and promoting the\r\nvirtual market place. These Start-ups have exponentially manifold their\r\nprofit turnover just in 2-3 years comprising of Millions of User-base at a\r\ntime. On the other hand a Social Networking platform has emerged in the recent\r\nyears which has also increased its User-base exponentially from 1000 5 years\r\nback to 1 Billion at present: Facebook. Since Facebook achieved its dominant\r\npart of the traffic from India and even though Shopping giants advertise\r\nvarious discounts on friend referral signup via Facebook, the system does not\r\nreally turn out to be a profitable one neither helping out the firm neither the\r\nUsers since the Firms use tacky financial and technical bounds before User\r\ncould really avail to those discounts. There is need for a system which could\r\ntake the best of both Shopping and Socializing Platform in a country comprising\r\nof 1.27Billion population where people are more social compared to other\r\ncountries while bringing out the best of downtrodden crisis that the economy of\r\nIndia face today (Consistent decline of GDP).\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nProject CSSP does just that using the best of both worlds where the\r\ntradition of gifting comes to life in a way rejoicing as well adaptive to Indian\r\npsychology. It imports user’s cart from just any shopping site, converts it\r\ninto a wish list to be displayed on user’s wall and broadcasts the wish list to\r\nall of user’s friends which are indeed invited from Facebook. The gifting\r\nsystem awards points equivalent to amount gifted and in return receives\r\ndiscount coupons which can be used on supported sites and retail outlets.\r\nFriends can also collect points and redeem them for a bigger coupon\r\naccordingly. User receives gift amount from friends which can then be used to\r\nfulfil the wish list. The amount equivalent to the gifting amount is deducted\r\nfrom the person gifting mobile balance using in-app purchase feature which\r\nremoves the hassle for Credit/Debit card payment system and make gifting a\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2013, Ayush K. Singh (@iblong2iyush) founded CSSP and is a working prototype.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
