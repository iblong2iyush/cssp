<p>In the past 3 years, Online Shopping has flourished in a Country where the GDP
recently fell from 4.8 to 3.69 and yet falling day after day. While websites
like Myntra and Jabong remain the major players of the Market and advertise
themselves to the Indian Sentimental Economy encouraging people to spend more
and more on luxury items derailing the conventional markets and promoting the
virtual market place. These Start-ups have exponentially manifold their
profit turnover just in 2-3 years comprising of Millions of User-base at a
time. On the other hand a Social Networking platform has emerged in the recent
years which has also increased its User-base exponentially from 1000 5 years
back to 1 Billion at present: Facebook. Since Facebook achieved its dominant
part of the traffic from India and even though Shopping giants advertise
various discounts on friend referral signup via Facebook, the system does not
really turn out to be a profitable one neither helping out the firm neither the
Users since the Firms use tacky financial and technical bounds before User
could really avail to those discounts. There is need for a system which could
take the best of both Shopping and Socializing Platform in a country comprising
of 1.27Billion population where people are more social compared to other
countries while bringing out the best of downtrodden crisis that the economy of
India face today (Consistent decline of GDP).</p>

<a name="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h3>

<p>Project CSSP does just that using the best of both worlds where the
tradition of gifting comes to life in a way rejoicing as well adaptive to Indian
psychology. It imports user’s cart from just any shopping site, converts it
into a wish list to be displayed on user’s wall and broadcasts the wish list to
all of user’s friends which are indeed invited from Facebook. The gifting
system awards points equivalent to amount gifted and in return receives
discount coupons which can be used on supported sites and retail outlets.
Friends can also collect points and redeem them for a bigger coupon
accordingly. User receives gift amount from friends which can then be used to
fulfil the wish list. The amount equivalent to the gifting amount is deducted
from the person gifting mobile balance using in-app purchase feature which
removes the hassle for Credit/Debit card payment system and make gifting a
breeze.</p>
